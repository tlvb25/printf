# 0x10. C - printf

## Description
This was our 1st C-Programming Milestone Project:

* We learned how to construct our own version of Printf (_Printf)
* We learned how to use GitHub with a partner, as is done in the industry.
* We learned how to construct a man page for our custom (_Printf) function.

### [0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life]
* Write a function that produces output according to a format.
* Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
* write output to stdout, the standard output stream
* format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers: 

* c
* s
* %


### [1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't]
* Handle the following conversion specifiers: 

* d
* i



### [2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel]
* Create a man page for your function.

- File: man_3_printf


### [3. With a face like mine, I do better in print]
* Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:
- b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary
